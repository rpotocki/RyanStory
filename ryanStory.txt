A long time ago there was an old lady who lived up on a hill in the mountains. She lived with her daughter, Kelly, and their dog, Sam. One day they decided to go for a walk down the mountain to the village to get some food.

Kelly was so excited about their trip. She planned to visit her best friend, Liz. Every time, Kelly went to Liz's house to enjoy a party. Liz's mother always baked a delicious cake for the girls.
