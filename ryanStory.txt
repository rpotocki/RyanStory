A long time ago there was an old lady who lived up on a hill in the mountains. She lived with her daughter, Kelly, and their dog, Sam. One day they decided to go for a walk down the mountain to the village to get some food.

Kelly was so excited about their trip. She planned to visit her best friend, Liz. Every time, Kelly went to Liz's house to enjoy a party. Liz's mother always baked a delicious cake for the girls. 

And there were many friends there, they always played games together. But on that day, something strange happened.

After Kelly walked down hill and when reached Liz's house, she found that the door was half-closed. 
She tried to open the door. At first, she was curious about what is going on, until she found a stain of blood on the floor.
When she raised her head and she saw something was hanging on the ceiling. 
After she recognized what that was, she was frightened and fainted.

She woke up in the hospital unsure of what happened. When she asked the nurse she said her mom carried her to the doctor because she found her passed out.  It turns out the blood she saw was actually frosting from the cake!
