A long time ago there was an old lady who lived up on a hill in the mountains. She lived with her daughter, Kelly, and their dog, Sam. One day they decided to go for a walk down the mountain to the village to get some food.

Kelly was so excited about their trip. She planned to visit her best friend, Liz.
